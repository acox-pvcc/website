			<h2 style="color:#fcfaf7;">Background and Prior Events</h2>
			<p style="color:#fcfaf7;">For hundreds of years, slavery was legal and practiced in the United States prior to the enactment of the 13th Amendment. Forced migration of slaves from Africa to the southern states' plantations took place. They weren't granted any of the freedoms or liberties that white People did since they were viewed as property. Slavery has been a major source of contention and strife throughout American history, sparking the Civil War in 1861.</p>
			<p style="color:#fcfaf7;">Emancipation Proclamation during the American Civil War, ordering the freedom of all slaves in Rebel states. This declaration only applied to Confederate states that had left the Union, so it did not immediately release all slaves. The Emancipation Proclamation did not modify the Constitution and did not offer slavery any kind of long-term defense.</p>

			<h2 style="color:#fcfaf7;">The 13th Amendment's Background and Effects</h2>
			<p style="color:#fcfaf7;">John B. Henderson, a senator from Missouri, presented the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in Congress in 1864. The amendment was then approved by both the Senate and the House of Representatives on April 8, 1864, and January 31, 1865, respectively. On December 6, 1865, it was ratified by the necessary number of states.</p>
			<p style="color:#fcfaf7;">Slavery and forced labor were outlawed by the 13th Amendment, with the exception of punishment for crimes. Additionally, it gave Congress the authority to implement the amendment through the necessary legislation. The United States underwent substantial transformation as a result of this amendment, including the emancipation of all slaves.</p>

			<h2 style="color:#fcfaf7;">The 13th Amendment and Modern Day Relevance</h2>
			<p style="color:#fcfaf7;">Since it serves as a reminder of the horrors of slavery and the fight for freedom and equality, the 13th Amendment is still important today. Despite the fact that slavery is illegal in the United States today, discrimination and inequality still exist there. The amendment is still a potent representation of the struggle for equality and justice for all.</p>
